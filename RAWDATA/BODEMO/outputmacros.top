[Aim high to the sky, \n
In all that you do. \n

That youâ€™re using your mind. ]

so sweetly she couldn't remember her troubles,and \n
milly befriended a stranded star \n
whose rays five languid fingers were; \n
and molly was chased by a horrible thing \n
which raced sideways while blowing bubbles:and \n
may came home with a smooth round stone \n
as small as a world and as large as alone. \n
For whatever we lose(like a you or a me) \n
it's always ourselves we find in the sea ]
[The Road goes ever on and on \n
Down from the door where it began. \n
Now far ahead the Road has gone, \n
And I must follow, if I can, \n
Pursuing it with eager feet, \n
Until it joins some larger way \n
Where many paths and errands meet. \n
And whither then? I cannot say. ]
